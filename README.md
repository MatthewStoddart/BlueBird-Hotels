# Welcome to BlueBird Hotels!

I created this website to practice the skills I had learned while watching tutorials on YouTube and taking courses from Udemy. I made this project with HTML, CSS, and a little jQuery. it is definitely a beginner website, but I like to go back and look at it every once in a while.

You can view the finished website [here!](https://mystifying-einstein-5c95ea.netlify.com/)
